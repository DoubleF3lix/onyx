## Installation
The package can be installed with `pip`:
```
pip install onyx-mclib
```

## Getting Started
First, you'll need to define your datapack object. This can be done with `pack = pack(file_path)`. Now you can get started defining functions.

A basic function should look something like this:
```python
from onyx import *
pack = pack(file_path)

main = pack.function("function/path", "function_name")
with main:
    say("Hello, World!")
```
You can make a function run every tick by using `pack.function("function_path", "function_name", loop=True)`.

## Selectors
Selectors are defined very similar to the normal game, and are done like so:
```python
alive_players_in_arena = selector(at.all_players, tag="alive", y=0, dy=63)
```
Onyx will automatically convert types, so if you don't want to define a selector for something simple, you can just pass in `"@a"` instead of `selector(at.all_players)`.

## JSON Strings
JSON strings (also known as text-components) have a builder design. They can be chained too, to seperate components with differing elements.
```python
text = json_string().component("Hello, ").component(text="World!", color=color.gold, bold=True, italic=True)
tellraw("@a", text)
```
